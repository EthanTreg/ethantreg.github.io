# Abstract

Black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) offer insights into extreme gravitational environments and the testing of general relativity.
The X-ray spectrum collected by NICER offers valuable information on the properties and behaviour of BHBs through spectral
fitting. However, traditional spectral fitting methods are slow and scale poorly with model complexity. This paper presents a
new semi-supervised autoencoder neural network for parameter prediction and spectral reconstruction of BHBs, showing an
improvement of up to a factor of 2,700 in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy. The approach maps the spectral features
from the numerous outbursts catalogued by NICER and generalises them to new systems for efficient and accurate spectral
fitting. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the spectral fitting of BHBs and holds promise for use in other
areas of astronomy and physics for categorising large datasets.
