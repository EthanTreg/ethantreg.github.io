# Abstract

Advancements in space telescopes have opened new avenues for gathering vast amounts of data on exoplanet atmosphere spectra.
However, accurately extracting chemical and physical properties from these spectra poses significant challenges due to the non-linear nature of the underlying physics.
This paper presents novel machine learning models developed by the [AstroAI](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/) (AstroAI is hosted by the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian) team for the [Ariel Data Challenge 2023](https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space/), where one of the models secured the top position among 293 competitors.
Leveraging Normalizing Flows, our models predict the posterior probability distribution of atmospheric parameters under different atmospheric assumptions.
Moreover, we introduce an alternative model that exhibits higher performance potential than the winning model, despite scoring lower in the challenge.
These findings highlight the need to reevaluate the evaluation metric and prompt further exploration of more efficient and accurate approaches for exoplanet atmosphere spectra analysis.
Finally, we present recommendations to enhance the challenge and models, providing valuable insights for future applications on real observational data.
These advancements pave the way for more effective and timely analysis of exoplanet atmospheric properties, advancing our understanding of these distant worlds.
