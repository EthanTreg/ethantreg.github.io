# Abstract

Advancements in space telescopes have opened new avenues for gathering vast
amounts of data on exoplanet atmosphere spectra. However, accurately extracting chemical
and physical properties from these spectra poses significant challenges due to the non-linear
nature of the underlying physics.
This paper presents novel machine learning models developed by the AstroAI1011 team for
the Ariel Data Challenge 202312, where one of the models secured the top position among
293 competitors. Leveraging Normalizing Flows, our models predict the posterior probability
distribution of atmospheric parameters under different atmospheric assumptions.
Moreover, we introduce an alternative model that exhibits higher performance potential than
the winning model, despite scoring lower in the challenge. These findings highlight the need to
reevaluate the evaluation metric and prompt further exploration of more efficient and accurate
approaches for exoplanet atmosphere spectra analysis.
Finally, we present recommendations to enhance the challenge and models, providing valuable
insights for future applications on real observational data. These advancements pave the way
for more effective and timely analysis
